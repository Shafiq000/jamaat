            "question": "Should One Pray The Missed Prayer First?",
            "answer": "If you miss a prayer, then you have to pray that prayer first, then pray the current prayer; it is not permissible to delay making up the missed prayer.",
            "explanation": "Praise be to Allah.\nIf you miss a prayer, then you have to pray that prayer first, then pray the current prayer; it is not permissible to delay (making up the missed prayer). It is commonly thought among the people that if a man misses an obligatory prayer, he should make it up with the corresponding obligatory prayer of the next day, so that if, for example, he missed Fajr on one day he can only pray it with Fajr on the second day. This is wrong, and it goes against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in both his words and deeds. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, then let him pray it when he remembers it.' He did not say, let him pray it on the following day when the time for that prayer comes, rather he said, 'let him pray it when he remembers it.' With regard to the Prophet’s actions, when he missed a prayer on one of the days of the campaign of Al-Khandaq, he prayed it before the current prayer, which indicates that one has to pray the missed prayer and then pray the current prayer. But if he forgets and prays the current prayer before the missed prayer, or he was ignorant and did not know (of the ruling), then his prayer is valid because he has an excuse. (See Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 12, p. 222). The hadith about the prayer on the day of Al-Khandaq was narrated by An-Nasa’i from ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Abu Sa`id from his father, who said: 'The disbelievers kept us busy on the day of Al-Khandaq and distracted us from praying Dhuhr until the sun set. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilal to call the Iqamah for Dhuhr prayer, and he prayed it, then he called the Iqamah for Asr and he prayed it, then he called the Adhan for Maghrib then he prayed it as he usually prayed it, on time.' (Al-Adhan, 655; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, no. 638)\n And Allah knows best."

            "question": "Why Is Divorce in the Husband's Hands?",
            "answer": "The reasons why divorce is in the man’s hand are: • The husband is the one in whose hand is the marriage contract, so he is the one in whose hand is the dissolution of this contract. • The husband is in charge of the woman. • The man is more perfect in reason than the woman, and more far-sighted, so you do not see him choosing to divorce unless there is no alternative.",
            "explanation": "Praise be to Allah.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) explained that divorce is in the man’s hand because he holds the marriage contract, is the protector and maintainer of the woman as per [al-Nisa’ 4:34], is more rational and far-sighted, and hence less likely to divorce without necessity, while the wife might be more emotionally driven; however, divorce can be obligatory, prohibited, recommended, disliked, or permissible depending on circumstances, with the basic principle being that it is not desirable unless necessary to avoid misery and suffering in the marriage \nAnd Allah knows best."

            "explanation": "Praise be to Allah.\nMasturbation is haraam in Islam for both men and women based on Quranic verses and Hadith, with Al-Imam Shafi'i and scholars citing verses such as Al-Muminun 23:5-7 and Al-Nur 24:33, and Hadith from Al-Bukhari 5066; it is recommended to marry, lower the gaze, keep busy with good deeds, avoid medically harmful habits, not be deceived by false justifications, strengthen willpower, follow proper bedtime etiquette, strive for patience and chastity, repent if one falls into sin, and seek Allah's forgiveness and help.

            "question": "She suffers from perfectionism, which leads to procrastination",
            "answer": "The Muslim’s striving for perfection in his attitude, worship and interactions with people is a good thing, and his efforts to attain that are efforts aimed at attaining sublime goals. But this perfectionism may conflict with the real-life situation in which the Muslim lives, and that may lead to frustration",
            "explanation": "Praise be to Allah.\nThe Muslim’s striving for perfection in attitude, worship, and interactions is commendable, but moderation is key to avoid frustration and discouragement. The Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) advised moderation: “Do your best, but do not go to extremes; pray during the forenoon and the afternoon, and during a part of the night; always adopt a moderate course and you will reach your goal” (al-Bukhari 6098). To overcome perfectionism, set realistic goals, avoid comparisons, not fear criticism, and consider seeing a specialist if needed. To combat procrastination, be firm and resolute, understand it stems from weakness, constantly supplicate to Allah, associate with motivated individuals, and learn from early generations who avoided procrastination. May Allah guide you to what pleases Him.\nAnd Allah knows best."

            "explanation": "Praise be to Allah.\nSending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) is highly meritorious, especially on Fridays and the night before, as emphasized by various hadiths. Using an app to remind yourself and set targets for sending blessings is permissible as long as you don't believe in specific virtues tied to the target number. Displaying overall numbers and percentages is also acceptable if it encourages others, provided it doesn’t lead to self-admiration. It's important not to become dependent on the app for motivation; once you are consistent, rely on your own practice.\nAnd Allah knows best."

            "explanation":"Praise be to Allah.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) advised dusting off the bed with the edge of one's garment before lying down to avoid harm, and reciting the supplication: “In Your name, my Lord, I lie down, and in Your name I rise. If You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves.” (Bukhari 6320, Muslim 2714).

            "question": "How can we reconcile between affirming Allah’s exaltedness and the verse and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand?",
            "explanation":"Praise be to Allah.\nThere is no contradiction between affirming the exaltedness of Allah, may He be exalted, and the fact that on the Day of Resurrection He will roll up the heavens in His right hand, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):{They have not given due recognition to Allah. On the Day of Resurrection, the entire earth will be in His grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and exalted be Allah far above the partners they ascribe to Him!} [az-Zumar 39:67].That is because exaltedness means that Allah, may He be exalted, is above all things, above the heavens, above the Throne and above everything that is created. He is exalted in the sense of controlling and subduing, and exalted in His Essence (in a true sense). Thus He is the Exalted, the Most High, as is stated in His Book and by His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and as was unanimously agreed upon by the early generations of the ummah.What is narrated in the texts about Allah being “in heaven” – such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16];The hadith narrated from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is in heaven”;The hadith narrated by Muslim (537) from Mu‘awiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami about his striking his slave woman. He said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he regarded that as a grievous action on my part. I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I set her free? He said: “Bring her to me.” So I brought her to him and he said to her: “Where is Allah?” She said: In heaven. He said: “Who am I?” She said: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: “Set her free, for she is a believer.”What is meant by fi’s-sama’ (translated here as “in heaven”) is exaltedness, because anything that is high above may be called sama’ in Arabic.Or it may mean above the heaven, because prepositions in Arabic may be used interchangeably, as in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]  the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.None of Ahl as-Sunnah suggest that Allah is inside the seven heavens, or that anything of His creation encompasses Him; exalted be Allah far above that.Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari says in his letter to the people on the border (Risalah ila Ahl ath-Thaghr, p. 130), regarding what was agreed upon by Ahl as-Sunnah: That Allah, may He be exalted, is above His heavens, above His throne. This is indicated by the verses (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16] and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10].And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5]. His rising over the Throne does not mean that He has control of it, as the Qadaris said, because He, may He be glorified and exalted, has always been above all things. End quote.Al-Bayhaqi said in al-I‘tiqad (p. 112): Chapter regarding Allah’s rising above the Throne. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5].The Throne is the well-known seat that is known to people of reason. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and His Throne had been upon water} [Hud 11:7]… and {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [an-Nahl 16:50], and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10] and {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16].What is meant is the One Who is above the heavens, as Allah says elsewhere: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]   the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.Everything that is up above may be called sama’ in Arabic, and the Throne is above the highest heavens.What the verse means – and Allah knows best – is: Do you feel secure that He Who is on the Throne [will not cause the earth to swallow you up…], as is clearly stated in other verses. End quote.Al-Hafiz ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16], what it means is: the One Who is above the heavens, meaning above the Throne.The Arabic preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) as in the verses: and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]  the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land, and {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].(At-Tamhid  7/130).Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: In response, we may adopt one of two interpretations:1. Either we may understand as-sama’ as referring to what is up above, and as-sama’ in the sense of what is up above is well known in Arabic, and indeed, in the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {He sends down water from the heaven [as-sama’] and the watercourses flow} [ar-Ra‘d 13:17]; what is meant by as-sama’ [translated here as heaven] is what is up above, because the water comes down from the clouds, not from as-sama’, which is the canopy of heaven, whereas the cloud is up high, between heaven and earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth} [al-Baqarah 2:164].So what is meant by the One Who is in heaven is the One Who is up above.There is no problem after that, for Allah is up above; there is nothing at the same level as Him and nothing above Him.2.. Or we may understand the preposition fi (“in”) as meaning ‘ala (“above”), and regard as-sama’ as being the canopy of heaven raised high, referring to the heavenly bodies, as the preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) in Arabic. In fact, in the Qur’an, Pharaoh says to his people, the magicians who believed: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].Thus the meaning of the One Who is in the heaven is the One Who is above the heaven.(Sharh al-Wasitiyyah  1/398).Once this is clear, it is the same whether the heavens are there or Allah, may He be glorified, has rolled up the heavens in His Right Hand, for He is above all things, and He has no need of the heavens or the Throne.At-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his ‘Aqidah (p. 54): The Throne and the Footstool are real, and Allah has no need of the Throne nor anything beneath it; He encompasses and is above all things. End quote.Conclusion:The confusion about the apparent contradiction is only caused by thinking that Allah, may He be exalted, is in the heavens or that He needs the heavens to be exalted.He, may He be glorified, is far above both, for nothing encompasses Him and He has no need of anything, may He be blessed, exalted and sanctified.You should understand that there is no alternative to believing that He is exalted, except two views which are both false: the view that Allah is present everywhere, as the Jahamis said, and the view that Allah is neither inside the universe not outside it, as the Ash‘aris said.Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) concluded his book al-‘Uluw li’l-‘Ali al-Ghaffar by saying:Allah is above His Throne, as the early generations were agreed on and the leading scholars narrated it from them. They said that in refutation of the Jahamis, who said that Allah is everywhere, and quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and He is with you} [al-Hadid 57:4].These two views are those that existed at the time of the Tabi‘in and succeeding generations and they are reasonable views in general.As for the third view which developed recently – which says that Allah, may He be exalted, is nowhere; He is not outside anything or above His Throne; He is not connected to His creation or separate from them; His holy Essence is not separate from His creation; He is not in any direction and is not outside the directions; and He is not this and not that, and so on – this is something that makes no sense and is incomprehensible, in addition to being contrary to the religious texts.So flee for the sake of your faith and beware of the views of ahl al-kalam. Believe in Allah and what came from Allah, as Allah intended it, and delegate your affairs to Allah, for there is no power and no strength except with Allah.(Al-‘Uluw, p. 267).\nAnd Allah knows best"

So long as the marriage contract fulfils the necessary requirements and conditions, then it is valid. Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it essential for the marriage to be valid that a man should inform the woman he wants to marry that he is married to another one, if he is not asked about that? Are there any consequences if he denies it if he is asked? He replied: “The man is not obliged to tell the woman or her family that he is married if they do not ask him, but that cannot usually be hidden because marriage is not usually done except after a period of enquiring and asking about each of the two partners and verifying that they are suitable. But it is not permissible to conceal any facts, and if either party tells a lie and the other party acts on the basis of it, then there is the option of cancelling it. If he says that he is not married and is lying about that, then the woman has the option of annulling the marriage. If they say that she was a virgin when she is not, then he has the option of going ahead with the marriage or cancelling it.For more details, please see the following answers: 61 , 12544 , 175097 , and 91899 .\nAnd Allah knows best."
